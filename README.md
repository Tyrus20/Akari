# Akari
Akari (also known as "light up") is a logic puzzle game where the objective is to 
place light-bulbs on a grid so that all white cells are lit.

### Rules
1. Light-bulbs may be added to or removed from a cell by left-clicking it with the mouse.
2. Light-bulbs may only be placed in white cells.
3. A cell is lit if it is in the same row or column as a light-bulb and there are no black cells between them.
4. Light-bulbs may not illuminate other light-bulbs.
5. Black cells with numbers inside them are clue cells. The number in a clue cell indicates the exact number of light-bulbs that share an edge with that cell.
6. The puzzle can only be completed if all white cells are lit and all clue cells are satisfied.

To start the game, run the main() method in the Main class.
